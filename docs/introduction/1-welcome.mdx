# The Design System 

<Intro>
  A design system is a living product, evolving alongside the organization it serves. This design system provides structured components, comprehensive documentation, and a unified design language to empower product teams. The 
  primary goal of this Design System is to create a system that can be used to build a wide variety of
  web applications, while providing a consistent, accessible, and performant
  user experience.
