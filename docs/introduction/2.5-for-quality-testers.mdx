# For Testers

<Intro>
The design system component library is built in React and we use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [@testing-library/react](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to unit test the business logic and accessibility of our components.
</Intro>

## Unit tests

To start unit tests in watch mode, run:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Visual tests

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to showcase and document our components. It integrates with the visual testing platform [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) who generously offer their services to our OSS project for free.

Chromatic builds the Storybook on every commit, takes a snapshot of each story and compares it to the previous snapshots. Whenever a visual change is detected, it can be reviewed and approved by anyone who has write access to the repo on GitHub.

## Linting

As for linting and formatting, you can configure your editor to automatically lint and format your code on save. For this purpose, we're using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). If you need to do it manually, you can run:

```bash
npm run lint
# Automatically fix (some) issues
npm run lint:fix
```
