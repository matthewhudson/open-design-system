# Getting Started 

## Resources

The idea for Atomic Design is created to Brad Frost, a designer whose book __[Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/)__ details all that goes into creating and maintaining robust design systems, allowing you to roll out higher quality, more consistent UIs faster than ever before. This book introduces a methodology for thinking of our UIs as thoughtful hierarchies, discusses the qualities of effective pattern libraries, and showcases techniques to transform your team's design and development workflow.
